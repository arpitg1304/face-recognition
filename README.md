# face-recognition

The purpose of this MATLAB based assignment is to implement the Eigenface and Fis-
herface methods for recognizing faces. You will be using face images from the Yale Face
Database B where there are 10 faces under 64 lighting conditions, see Figure 1. Using your
implementation, you will evaluate the ability of the algorithm to handle lighting conditions
of the probe images that differ from those in the training images.
